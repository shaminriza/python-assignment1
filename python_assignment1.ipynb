    "    an expression has a final value and also a data type. in the given examople final value is 4and data type is int.\n",
    "    python expressions only contain identifiers, literals, and operators so a string is also an expression.\n",
    "    \n",
    "   the basic function of an expression is to evaluate and assign a value. Expressions are crucial to evaluate various data. \n",
    "   if we ask the python interpreter to print an expression , it evaluates the data and print the final output. since expressions \n",
    "    contain various arithmetic operations, it is the backbone of any code we write.any program consist of a number  of such expressions.\n",
    "    A value all by itself is an expresion. similarly a variable also.They are different from statement in the fact that\n",
    "    statements do something while expressions are representation of value. \n",

    "    Declaration is a statement declaring a variable or a fuction.declarations inform the compiler or interpreter\n",
    "    what the identifying word means,and how the identified thing should be used. For example if we declare a[]\n",
    "    we are declaring that variable a is a list datatype and using this we can perform operations. similarly if we declare \n",
    "    spam=10 we are actually assigning integer value 10 to a variable called as spam. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    Basic difference between a declaration and expression is that expressions are used to do calculations using operators. to perform\n",
    "    calculations we need expressions. an expression has both value and a datatype. simply put, a declaration is statement that defines\n",

    "     variable bacon will contain a value of 22 . the first expression will assign an integer value of 22 to variable bacon\n",

    "\n",
    "   In python we can give any name of any length to variables.it can include numbers also. but the first digit of a variable should\n",
